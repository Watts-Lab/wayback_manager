The advisory was issued shortly after U.S. Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) authorities in Newark, New Jersey, seized about $800,000 worth imported goods from China, including human hair products.\\n</p><p>\\nXinjiang, China, is where an estimated one million Uighurs and other mostly Muslim ethnic minorities are facing an alleged expansive campaign of repression, including forced sterilization, destruction of religious sites and mass \"re-education\" camps.\\n</p><div data-box-type=\"fitt-adbox-incontentTeads\"><div class=\"Ad incontentTeads incontentTeads--story ad-slot\" data-slot-type=\"incontentTeads\" data-collapse-before-load=\"true\" data-slot-kvps=\"tag=news,objid=71559507,pgn=international,pgtyp=story,lang=en,sp=abcnews,programmatic=true,bundleId=com.abcnews,level=undefined,pos=incontentTeads\"></div></div><p>\\nThe shipments seized Wednesday contained about 13 tons of hair products suspected to be made with human hair that originated in Xinjiang, indicating potential human right abuses of forced child labor and imprisonment, according to a CBP statement.\\n</p><p>\\n“The production of these goods constitutes a very serious human rights violation, and the detention order is intended to send a clear and direct message to all entities seeking to do business with the United States that illicit and inhumane practices will not be tolerated in U.S. supply chains,” said Brenda Smith, executive assistant commissioner of CBP’s Office of Trade.</p><div><div class=\"CalloutLink\"><div class=\"CalloutLink-item\"><span><svg class=\"icon__svg\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\"><use xlink:href=\"#icon__plus\"></use></svg></span><a class=\"AnchorLink CalloutLink-text\" tabindex=\"0\" data-track-moduleofclick=\"Callout\" data-track-position=\"0\" data-track-ctatext=\"MORE-China-forces-birth-control-on-Uighurs-to-suppress-population\" href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200705014703/https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/china-forces-birth-control-muslims-suppress-population-71505564\">MORE: China forces birth control on Uighurs to suppress population</a></div></div></div><p>\\nCBP detained the shipment per a Withhold Release Order (WRO) on hair products manufactured by Lop County Meixin Hair Product Co.

The order instructed ports of entry nationwide to detain all products from Meixin based on “information that reasonably indicated that they are manufactured with the use of prison labor.”\\n</p><p>\\nWednesday\\'s advisory was jointly issued by the U.S. Department of State, the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the U.S. Department of Commerce and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS).\\n</p><p>\\nThe advisory warns private companies operating within the U.S. to be aware of the large-scale human rights abuses against Muslim minority groups as well as “deceptive practices employed by the [Chinese] government in Xinjiang.” The advisory noted the possibility of criminal prosecution and other legal ramifications private companies may face if caught maintaining supply chains linked to human rights abuses in Xinjiang.\\n</p><p>\\n“CEOs should read this notice closely and be aware of the reputational, economic, and legal risks of supporting such an assault on human dignity,\" Secretary of State <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200705014703/https://abcnews.go.com/alerts/trump-administration\" id=\"_ap_link_Mike Pompeo_TrumpAdministration_\" target=\"_blank\">Mike Pompeo</a> said at a press conference Wednesday.</p><div><div class=\"CalloutLink\"><div class=\"CalloutLink-item\"><span><svg class=\"icon__svg\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\"><use xlink:href=\"#icon__plus\"></use></svg></span><a class=\"AnchorLink CalloutLink-text\" tabindex=\"0\" data-track-moduleofclick=\"Callout\" data-track-position=\"1\" data-track-ctatext=\"MORE-Pompeo-says-enormous-evidence-for-unproven-theory-that-coronavirus-came-from-lab\" href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200705014703/https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/pompeo-enormous-evidence-unproven-theory-coronavirus-lab/story?id=70472857\">MORE: Pompeo says &#x27;enormous evidence&#x27; for unproven theory that coronavirus came from lab</a></div></div></div><p>\\nBeyond labor and goods from Xinjiang, the advisory warns U.S. companies from doing business with firms that are reliant on forced labor elsewhere in China. It also warns companies against assisting in the construction of the \"re-education\" camps or contributing to the government’s surveillance system in the region.\\n</p><p>\\nGiven the latest reports about a mass sterilization campaign, which the Chinese government has denied, Pompeo was asked whether the U.S. considers the crackdown on Muslim minorities like the Uighurs to be genocide.\\n</p><p>\\n\"The United States takes seriously our obligation to preserve human rights -- human rights of the people in China,” said Pompeo, calling on allies and Muslim nations to also pressure Beijing. “We\\'ll continue to do that.

By the time he left his position in 2014 — he wouldn\\'t say or let league staffers say “retire,” because he never stopped working — a league that fought for a foothold before him had grown to a more than $5 billion a year industry and made NBA basketball perhaps the world\\'s most popular sport after soccer.</p><p>\\n“Because of David, the NBA is a truly global brand — making him not only one of the greatest sports commissioners of all time, but also one of the most influential business leaders of his generation,” said Adam Silver, who followed Stern as commissioner. “Every member of the NBA family is the beneficiary of David’s vision, generosity and inspiration.”</p><p>\\nThriving on good debate in the boardroom and good games in the arena, Stern would say one of his greatest achievements was guiding a league of mostly black players that was plagued by drug problems in the 1970s to popularity with mainstream America.</p><p>\\nHe had a hand in nearly every initiative to do that, from the drug testing program, to the implementation of the salary cap, to the creation of a dress code.</p><p>\\nBut for Stern, it was always about “the game,” and his morning often included reading about the previous night\\'s results in the newspaper — even after technological advances he embraced made reading NBA.com easier than ever.</p><p>\\n“The game is what brought us here. It\\'s always about the game and everything else we do is about making the stage or the presentation of the game even stronger, and the game itself is in the best shape that it\\'s ever been in,” he said on the eve of the 2009-10 season, calling it “a new golden age for the NBA.”</p><p>\\nOne that was largely created by Stern during a three-decade run that turned countless ballplayers into celebrities who were known around the globe by one name: Magic, Michael, Kobe, LeBron, just to name a few.</p><p>\\nStern oversaw the birth of seven new franchises and the creation of the WNBA and NBA Development League, now the G League, providing countless opportunities to pursue careers playing basketball in the United States that previously weren’t available.</p><p>\\nNot bad for a guy who once thought his job might be a temporary one.</p><p>\\nHe had been the league’s outside counsel from 1966 to \\'78 and spent two years as the NBA’s general counsel, figuring he could always go back to his legal career if he found things weren’t working out after a couple of years.</p><p>\\nHe never did.</p><p>\\nAfter serving as the NBA\\'s executive vice president of business and legal affairs from 1980-84, he replaced Larry O\\'Brien as commissioner.</p><p>\\nOverlooked and ignored only a few years earlier, when it couldn\\'t even get its championship round on live network TV, the NBA saw its popularity quickly surge thanks to the rebirth of the Lakers-Celtics rivalry behind Magic Johnson and Larry Bird, followed by the entrance of Michael Jordan just a few months after Stern became commissioner.</p><p>\\nUnder Stern, the NBA would play nearly 150 international games and be televised in more than 200 countries and territories, and in more than 40 languages, and the NBA Finals and All-Star weekend would grow into international spectacles. The 2010 All-Star game drew more than 108,000 fans to Dallas Cowboys Stadium, a record to watch a basketball game.</p><p>\\n“It was David Stern being a marketing genius who turned the league around. That\\'s why our brand is so strong,” said Johnson, who announced he was retiring because of HIV in 1991 but returned the following year at the All-Star Game with Stern\\'s backing.</p><p>\\n“It was David Stern who took this league worldwide.”</p><p>\\nHe was fiercely protective of his players and referees when he felt they were unfairly criticized, such as when members of the Indiana Pacers brawled with Detroit fans in 2004, or when an FBI investigation in 2007 found that Tim Donaghy had bet on games he officiated, throwing the entire referee operations department into turmoil. With his voice rising and spit flying, Stern would publicly rebuke media outlets, even individual writers, if he felt they had taken cheap shots.</p><p>\\nBut he was also a relentless negotiator against those same employees in collective bargaining, and his loyalty to his owners and commitment to getting them favorable deals led to his greatest failures, lockouts in 1998 and 2011 that were the only times the NBA lost games to work stoppages. Though he had already passed off the heavy lifting to Silver by the latter one, it was Stern who faced the greatest criticism, as well as the damage to a legacy that had otherwise rarely been tarnished.</p><p>\\n“As tough an adversary as he was across the table, he never failed to recognize the value of our players, and had the vision and courage to make them the focus of our league’s marketing efforts — building the NBA into the empire it is today,” the NBPA said.</p><p>\\nDavid Joel Stern was born Sept. 22, 1942, in New York. A graduate of Rutgers University and Columbia Law School, he was dedicated to public service, launching the NBA Cares program in 2005 that donated more than $100 million to charity in five years.</p><p>\\nHe would begin looking internationally soon after becoming commissioner and the globalization of the game got an enormous boost in 1992, when Jordan, Johnson and Bird played on the U.S. Olympic Dream Team that would bring the sport a new burst of popularity while storming to the gold medal in Barcelona.</p><p>\\nStern capitalized on that by sending NBA teams to play preseason games against other NBA or international clubs, and opened offices in other countries. The league staged regular-season games in Japan in 1991 and devoted significant resources to China, and Stern\\'s work there would pay off in 2008 when basketball was perhaps the most popular sport in the Beijing Olympics.</p><p>\\nGrowth slowed near the end of his tenure. The worldwide economic downturn in the late 2000s all but wrecked his longtime hopes of expanding overseas and led to the second lockout, with owners wanting massive changes to the salary structure after losing hundreds of millions of dollars a year on their basketball teams, on top of losses in their personal businesses.</p><p>\\nHe helped get them, and the league was thriving again by the time he left office. Stern said he felt the time was right, confident that he had groomed a worthy successor in Silver, who had worked at the league for more than two decades.</p><p>\\nStern stayed busy, taking trips overseas on the league\\'s behalf, doing public speaking and consulting various companies. He was inducted to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2014.</p><p>\\nStern and his wife had two sons, Andrew and Eric.</p><p>\\n———</p><p>\\nMore AP NBA:         https://apnews.com/NBA

       "                 'title': 'Former NBA commissioner David Stern dies at 77 \\n Former NBA Commissioner David Stern dies at 77 weeks after suffering brain hemorrhage',\n",
       "                 'paragraphs': ['NEW YORK -- \\nDavid Stern, the\\nbasketball\\n-loving lawyer who took the NBA around the world during 30 years as its longest-serving commissioner and oversaw its growth into a global powerhouse, died Wednesday. He was 77.',\n",
       "                  'Stern suffered a brain hemorrhage on Dec. 12 and underwent emergency surgery. The league said he died with his wife, Dianne, and their family at his bedside.',\n",
       "                  '“The entire\\nbasketball\\ncommunity is heartbroken,” the National Basketball Players Association said. “David Stern earned and deserved inclusion in our land of giants.”',\n",
       "                  \"Stern had been involved with the NBA for nearly two decades before he became its fourth commissioner on Feb. 1, 1984. By the time he left his position in 2014 — he wouldn't say or let league staffers say “retire,” because he never stopped working — a league that fought for a foothold before him had grown to a more than $5 billion a year industry and made NBA basketball perhaps the world's most popular sport after soccer.\",\n",
       "                  '“Because of David, the NBA is a truly global brand — making him not only one of the greatest sports commissioners of all time, but also one of the most influential business leaders of his generation,” said Adam Silver, who followed Stern as commissioner. “Every member of the NBA family is the beneficiary of David’s vision, generosity and inspiration.”',\n",
       "                  'Thriving on good debate in the boardroom and good games in the arena, Stern would say one of his greatest achievements was guiding a league of mostly black players that was plagued by drug problems in the 1970s to popularity with mainstream America.',\n",
       "                  'He had a hand in nearly every initiative to do that, from the drug testing program, to the implementation of the salary cap, to the creation of a dress code.',\n",
       "                  \"But for Stern, it was always about “the game,” and his morning often included reading about the previous night's results in the newspaper — even after technological advances he embraced made reading NBA.com easier than ever.\",\n",
       "                  \"“The game is what brought us here. It's always about the game and everything else we do is about making the stage or the presentation of the game even stronger, and the game itself is in the best shape that it's ever been in,” he said on the eve of the 2009-10 season, calling it “a new golden age for the NBA.”\",\n",
       "                  'One that was largely created by Stern during a three-decade run that turned countless ballplayers into celebrities who were known around the globe by one name: Magic, Michael, Kobe, LeBron, just to name a few.',\n",
       "                  'Stern oversaw the birth of seven new franchises and the creation of the WNBA and NBA Development League, now the G League, providing countless opportunities to pursue careers playing basketball in the United States that previously weren’t available.',\n",
       "                  'Not bad for a guy who once thought his job might be a temporary one.',\n",
       "                  \"He had been the league’s outside counsel from 1966 to '78 and spent two years as the NBA’s general counsel, figuring he could always go back to his legal career if he found things weren’t working out after a couple of years.\",\n",
       "                  'He never did.',\n",
       "                  \"After serving as the NBA's executive vice president of business and legal affairs from 1980-84, he replaced Larry O'Brien as commissioner.\",\n",
       "                  \"Overlooked and ignored only a few years earlier, when it couldn't even get its championship round on live network TV, the NBA saw its popularity quickly surge thanks to the rebirth of the Lakers-Celtics rivalry behind Magic Johnson and Larry Bird, followed by the entrance of Michael Jordan just a few months after Stern became commissioner.\",\n",
       "                  'Under Stern, the NBA would play nearly 150 international games and be televised in more than 200 countries and territories, and in more than 40 languages, and the NBA Finals and All-Star weekend would grow into international spectacles. The 2010 All-Star game drew more than 108,000 fans to Dallas Cowboys Stadium, a record to watch a basketball game.',\n",
       "                  \"“It was David Stern being a marketing genius who turned the league around. That's why our brand is so strong,” said Johnson, who announced he was retiring because of HIV in 1991 but returned the following year at the All-Star Game with Stern's backing.\",\n",

With his voice rising and spit flying, Stern would publicly rebuke media outlets, even individual writers, if he felt they had taken cheap shots.',\n",
       "                  'But he was also a relentless negotiator against those same employees in collective bargaining, and his loyalty to his owners and commitment to getting them favorable deals led to his greatest failures, lockouts in 1998 and 2011 that were the only times the NBA lost games to work stoppages. Though he had already passed off the heavy lifting to Silver by the latter one, it was Stern who faced the greatest criticism, as well as the damage to a legacy that had otherwise rarely been tarnished.',\n",

       "                  \"Stern capitalized on that by sending NBA teams to play preseason games against other NBA or international clubs, and opened offices in other countries.

       "                  'After an unprecedented four-day policy meeting,\\nNorth Korea\\n\\'s leader also announced that the regime would develop \"new strategic weapons\" for its own defense, reported the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA), North Korea’s state news outlet, on Wednesday.',\n",
       "                  'North Korea took \"preemptive and crucial measures of halting its nuclear test and ICBM test fire and shutting down the nuclear test ground,\" as part of its negotiations with the U.S. but wasn\\'t rewarded with \"appropriate measures,\" Kim said.',\n",
       "                  '“Far from responding ... with appropriate measures, [the U.S.] conducted ... big and small joint military drills which its president personally promised to stop and threatened the former militarily through the shipment of ultra-modern warfare equipment into South Korea,” Kim said, according to KCNA.',\n",
       "                  'Kim declared that North Korea will develop its strategic weapons to ensure the security of the state until a lasting peace-keeping mechanism is ready and the U.S. takes back what are considered unfavorable policies toward the state.',\n",
       "                  '\"Kim Jong Un is accepting the stalled negotiations between the U.S. and the long-term sanctions imposed on North Korea,\" Cheong Seong-Chang, director of the Center for North Korea Studies at Sejong Institute, said. \"And he’s announcing a new direction to enhance the country’s nuclear and missile capabilities.\"',\n",
       "                  'Cheong speculated a high possibility that the strategic weapons Kim mentioned may refer to new inter-continental ballistic missiles or submarine-launched ballistic missiles, which the regime could test fire in 2020.',\n",
       "                  '\"If North Korea puts it into action, it won’t be helpful for the denuclearization negotiation and the efforts to settle peace in the Korean peninsula,\" South Korea’s Unification Ministry said in a statement released a few hours after the KCNA report.',\n",
       "                  \"It was the first time that Kim Jong Un’s new year plan was not aired on New Year's Day, since he took office in 2012.\",\n",
       "                  '\"The change in format from a broadcast new year speech to reports at a plenary meeting may be an effort to buy time. North Korea’s new \\'strategic weapon\\' might not be ready,\" Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul, said. \"For now, North Korea may focus on sanctions evasion rather than sanctions relief, and replace denuclearization diplomacy with strategic deterrence and nuclear blackmail.\"',\n",
       "                  'Reaffirming North Korea’s position of \"regime security first, then denuclearization,\" Kim left a margin open for the U.S. to return to the negotiation table.',\n",
       "                  '\"The scope and depth of bolstering our [nuclear] deterrent\" will depend \"on the U.S.\\' future attitude to the DPRK,\\'\" KCNA reported, citing Kim Jong Un.'],\n",
